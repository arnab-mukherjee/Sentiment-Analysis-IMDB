# Sentiment-Analysis-IMDB

This project is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative through sentiment analysis, and compare performance of three different models. <br/>
<br/>
Dataset - <br/>
The core dataset contains 50,000 reviews split evenly into 25k train
and 25k test sets. The overall distribution of labels is balanced (25k
pos and 25k neg). We also include an additional 50,000 unlabeled
documents for unsupervised learning. <br/>
